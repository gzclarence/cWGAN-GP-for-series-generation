# cWGAN-GP-for-series-generation
Conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial nets to regenerate 24-hour daily price series.

Points to note
  1. In this example data set, electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) price series are to be reproduced by the generator.
  2. The first 24 columns are the DAM price for each of the 24 hours. The rest are conditions of the day.
  3. To run the code, please find and install a compatible combination of packages first, and good luck!
